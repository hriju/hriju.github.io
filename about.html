                    <dd>Mikael Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist who is asked by a wealthy industrialist to write a
                        biography on his family. But what he really wants Blomkvist to do is to find out what happened
                        to his niece, who went missing 40 years ago. Blomkvist, at first, is not interested, till the
                        man offers to help him clear his name. Blomkvist, begins by talking to the man's relatives who
                        were there when the girl went missing. And some of them are not forth coming. Blomkvist
                        eventually believes that her disappearance might have something to do with some serial killings
                        that took place 20 years before she disappeared. So he asks for a research assistant. So the
                        industrialist's man suggests Lisbeth Salander, a talented hacker who does background checks for
                        them and who even did one on Blomkvist. When he sees her report, he's impressed and asks her to
                        work with him and she does. She's anti-social but is extremely
                        efficient.</span>
