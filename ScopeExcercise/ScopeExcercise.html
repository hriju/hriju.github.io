        it):

      <h3>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</h3>
     
        <b>Answer:</b>
        
        In way we can say that Functions and methods are the same in javascript, but a method is a function, 
        which is a property of an object. A
        function can be called directly by its name but 
        methods are called by its object name and its method name using dot notation or square bracket notation.
        Function has access to the data passed to that function, but a method has access to the properties of the class it belongs to.
      <h3>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</h3>
      <b> <b>Answer:</b></b>
‘this’ refers to the current object in a method or in a constructor.

      <h3>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</h3>
      
        <b>Answer:</b>

        equal.
